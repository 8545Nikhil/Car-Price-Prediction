The Aim of the project is to predict the price of used cars that depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car,  transmission and the mileage it gives and many more.
A model to predict the price of a used car should be developed in order to assess its value based on a variety of characteristics. Several factors affect the price of a used car, such as company, model, year, transmission, distance driven, fuel type, seller type, and owner type. As a result, it is crucial to know the car's actual market value before purchasing or selling it.
